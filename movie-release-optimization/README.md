🎬 Movie Release Optimization

Part of the Marvel Analytics by BC series — this project uses data analytics to determine the most optimal release timing for Marvel movies to maximize theatrical viewership and box office performance.

⸻

🧩 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze historical movie data — including release dates, competing releases, and performance metrics — to uncover patterns and timing strategies that impact box office outcomes.
By combining data from Marvel, Fox, and Sony superhero films with industry-wide releases, this analysis aims to identify the best window for future releases.

🧠 Problem Definition

Dependent variable:
🎟️ Total number of tickets sold / box office revenue (viewership performance)

Independent variables (Tier 1 & Tier 2):
	•	Release month and season
	•	Day of week and holiday proximity
	•	Genre and production company
	•	Competing major releases (±60 days window)
	•	IMDb and TMDB popularity metrics
	•	Budget and marketing proxy indicators
	•	Franchise continuity and studio ownership (Marvel, Fox, Sony)

🧮 Workflow Summary
	1.	Data Collection
	•	Gathered movie datasets from Kaggle (IMDB + TMDB).
	•	Scraped Marvel movie data (release dates, studios) from Wikipedia via Python.
	2.	Data Cleaning & Filtering
	•	Removed non-theatrical releases.
	•	Filtered competitors within ±60 days of each Marvel release.
	3.	Analysis
	•	Examined correlations between release timing, competition, and revenue.
	•	Visualized patterns using Python and Tableau.
	4.	Insights
	•	Identified seasonal and strategic patterns influencing performance.
	•	Built foundation for predictive modeling in future versions.

📊 Example Outputs
	•	filtered_movies.csv — list of competing movies around each Marvel release
	•	marvel_movies.csv — scraped Marvel movie release data from Wikipedia
	•	Visual dashboards exploring release timing vs. performance
